Celestial Coordinates in Shapefiles


The celestial coordinate system is similar to the geographic system of latitude 
and longitude, but it has several key differences:

  1)  Right ascension (longitude) is measured in hours, where one hour is 15 
      degrees, while declination (latitude) is measured directly in degrees.
      Geographic latitude and longitude are both measured in degrees.

  2)  Right ascension does not use negative numbers.  It measures from 0 to 
      24 hours (0 to 360 degrees).  Geographic longitude measures from -180 
      to 180 degrees.

  3)  Both longitude and right ascension increase toward the east.  But unlike 
      the Earth, the celestial sphere is viewed from the inside.  So when 
      mapped, right ascension values increase from right to left, opposite the
      X-axis.  Geographic longitude increases from left to right.

In shapefiles, right ascension must fit into the scheme of geographic longitude 
so that astronomical data are displayed and projected properly.  To do this, 
the following algorithms are used:

  Right ascension hours to longitude degrees, when storing data in a shapefile

      lon = -RA * 15    if lon < -180 then lon = lon + 360

  Longitude degrees to right ascension hours, when displaying coordinate values

      RA = -lon / 15    if RA < 0 then RA = RA + 360

These algorithms produce the following mapping of right ascension to longitude:

     RA      RA       Lon
    hours  degrees  degrees
    -----  -------  -------
      0        0        0
      6       90      -90
     12      180     -180
     18      270       90
     24      360        0
