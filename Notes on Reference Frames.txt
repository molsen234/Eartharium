Astronomical Coordinate Transformations
=======================================

Frame types
-----------
Mean equator/ecliptic and equinox: precession is accounted for
True equator/ecliptic and equinox: precession and nutation are accounted for


Apparent position: Aberration (and sometimes speed of light) is accounted for (parallax?)
Geometric position: where the object actually is located at the instant?

Inertial means non-moving, non-rotating reference frame.
Dynamic meand non-inertial. Mean dynamic has precession applied, true dynamic has precession and nutation applied.


Coordinate types
----------------
Ecliptic: referenced to plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun and the northbound equinox
Equatorial: referenced to plane of Earth's equator and the northbound equinox
Topocentric: referenced to the observer position on the surface of Earth (or other body)

Coordinate origins
------------------
Heliocentric:  centered on the center of mass of the Sun
Barycentric:   centered on the center of mass of the solar system, i.e. the barycenter
Geocentric:    centered on the center of mass of the Earth
EMB:           (Earth-Moon Barycenter) centered on the center of mass of the Earth-Moon system
Selenocentric: centered on the center of mass of the Moon
Planetocentric:generic term, centered on the center of pass of a planet
Areocentric:   centered on the center of mass of Mars

Planetographic: These are coordinates based on ellipsoid surface normals, thus "down" does not point to the center of mass.

Note: planetocentric coordinates are useful for celestial sphere positions,
      planetographic are useful for observer positions (as they take the ellipsoid into account.)
	  -detic coordinates are different from these two, look up details.


Stellar Objects
---------------
Catalogue coordinates are as read from catalogue typically in geocentric equatorial coordinates
True coordinates are catalogue coordinates with proper motion, precession and nutation applied
The process of calculating the apparent position for an observer on Earth is as follows:
- Read the catalogue coordinates and proper motion (typically in Equatorial coordinates RA,Dec)
- Apply the proper motion to the retrieved coordinates
- Precess the coordinates from catalogue epoch (typically J2000) to equator and equinox of date.
- Apply nutation
- Apply aberration
- Optionally apply parallax (which is very tiny for stars) and transform to observer frame ?
Note: With stellar objects, conventionally there is no light time compensation as the geometric position doesn't matter

Solar System Objects
--------------------
Positions of solar system objects are typically calculated from an Ephemeris rather than read from a catalogue.
The ephemeris can either be simple evaluations of conic section orbits, or of large tables of coefficients interpolating more complete physical models.

For planets using the VSOP87 ephemeris, proceed as follows:
- Calculate the Ecliptic coordinates via the ephemeris
- Iterate until light time adjustments are below a chosen threshold
- Apply ecliptic aberration
- Apply FK5 correction
- Apply nutation (in longitude)
- Convert to Equatorial coordinates using obliquity of ecliptic (Mean or true?)
- Optionally apply parallax and transform to observer coordinates (Topocentric, Alt/Az or otherwise)

Note: One may wonder why stellar objects apply nutation before aberration while solar system objects do the opposite.
      While the difference is small, it is worth while looking into this detail.

Notes and quotes:
-----------------
"Mean Ecliptic and Equinox of Date Frames are closely related to mean equator and equinox of date frames: for a given body, the former is obtained by rotating the latter about the X-axis by the mean obliquity of date." [NAIF]
