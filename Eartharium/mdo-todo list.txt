ToDo for Eartharium
===================


IMPPORTANT
----------
- MUST make Path3D multisegment to accomodate redrawing of split arcs across seams of Earth
  o It can only split once, so having two segments will suffice
  o !! BUT for time dependent paths, they may move to have the split in a different place !!
  o For paths fixed to the ground, no problem with the two path approach.

= MUST implement a thin line primitive that can extend arrows to their target,
  rather than the ugly cludge currently implemented on Location::addArrow3DFlatSun() !!!
  UPD: This is now slightly better. Earth still has no lines though.

- Apparently the day and night textures for Earth do not match well in ice coverage at the poles.

= GUI crashes when certain objects do not exist. 

NEW IDEAS
---------
= Implement a LERPer
  v Provide start and end points, and number of steps
  o Possibly in arrays so it can LERP multiple values to same stepcount - alternative: Lerp Group
  v Can form basis for animations
  v Should have optional easing of values (stepfunction as per GLSL, see youtube )
  v Should be able to loop (start to end, start to end) and bounce (start to end, end to start) or halt (start to end, end, end, end...)
  o Still need the bounce part of previous item
- Defect: Transparent primitives fill the depth buffer, so opaque primitives drawn later are fully obscured and not multiplied in
  o There is no way to fix this simply with blending functions. Here is a tool to play with the OpenGL blend options: http://andersriggelsen.dk/glblendfunc.php
  o Could be fixed by drawing them in order of opaqueness, solid first whispy last
  o Or might be solvable by Z sorting in view space and disabling depth buffer while drawing
  o See: http://jcgt.org/published/0002/02/09/ (PDF and video)
  o & accompanying blogpost: http://casual-effects.blogspot.com/2014/03/weighted-blended-order-independent.html

Animation
---------
- Frames: Animations should be frame based, so every animator should take duration in frames
    Everything else will be animated parameters, based on the frame duration.
	E.g. morphing Earth from AE to NS takes param = [0.0;1.0], so over 30 frames, it should update by 1/30 per frame
	Hence, many animators will simply use the Lerper.
	o Some situatations make this difficult 
- The sort of things to animate
  o DateTime - Astronomical positions depend on time and date.
  o Earth morph
  o Add/Remove Locations (Location Groups? Yes!)
  o Add/Remove items to Locations or Location Groups
  o Item properties: Color, length, width
  o Item Path3D "WriteOn", maybe color too, so flight paths can indicate how far the plane has gone etc.
  o Camera location, lookat, yaw,pitch,roll, FoV
  o SkyBox with StarLocs (PlanetLocs?), SkyPaths?
  

Framebuffering
--------------
- I need a more consistent viewport and framebuffer infrastructure to solve the following
  v Render is still strange around BACK/FRONT buffers from GLFW - for now single buffer with glFlush()
    UPD: Reverted to double buffers and glfwSwapfBuffers() it seems to work consistently with writing to file as well
  o What if I want to render to higher resolution, but keep GUI interactions in lower resolution
  o Applying post processing like smoothing, gamma correction etc.
  o More robust frame output perhaps writing to video containers with ffmpeg
  o Picture in picture via framebuffer -> quad re-rendering


Camera
------
- Strafe turn and walk
- Proper LookAt function
- Ability to smoothly blend from perspective to orthogonal
- Structure with camera parameters, for animating and restoring previous views?
- Tying the camera to an output device / framebuffer / rectangle, for easier picture in picture


Location
--------
+ Make all primitives removable:
  + Dots, Cones, Cylinders, Planes, ViewCones,
  + Arrows
  o Paths
  o Others?
- Scale arrows when updating SkySphere radius?
- Analemmas, Sun/Moon True/Flat
= Ground arrow to tracked object, possibly tied to Location rather than Track
  UPD: Made line to do that for SubsolarPoint
- Azi Ele calculation based on XYZ of object
- Parameter display for
  o Arrow azi, ele, with protractor or simple billboard number
  o azi along path
  o Local solar time (with Eqn of Time)
  o Local secular time (without Eqn of Time)
+ Tangent plane (oriented to North,East vectors, of Size slightly larger than SkySphere
= Meridian plane like Tangent plane - Orientation is a bit weird
- 2D Arrows, in surface for True/Flat Sun/Moon/Tracked Ob/Planets 
- Arrows and Paths for Star from catalogue
- Arrows and Paths for remaining planets
- Local starry sky (textured, or with dots, or point primitives in OpenGL


Spheres
-------
+ Will want UV mappable spherical shapes for Sun, Moon etc
- For Location Sky, this may be cool to WriteOn when placing
- Should also support a basic grid like lat/lon on Earth, for astronomy explanations
- Transparency can be moved from Dots to here, to give a good render order - have to think about blending some more.
= Support textured objects, but those will probably derive from a basic Sphere

Earth
-----
- To facilitate unwrapping a sphere to an AE projection at any point, make texture repeated and remap texture coordinates via a rotation matrix / quaternion
  Earth will need to have a texture pole for this to work. How to do this generically for all geometries? 
+ Make all dots removable
- Make all paths removable
+ Arctic circles
+ Tropics
+ Equator
+ Great Arc segment
+ LERP Arc segment
+ Flat Arc segment
= Paths for Sun and Moon terminators
  UPD: Sun done, Moon left
- Moon with the following capabilities:
  o Position
  o Phase
  o Libration
  o View from Earth Location?
  o Visibility in Inner SolarSystem
- Setting refraction for Sun and Moon dynamically
- Turn on/off or adjust twilight
- Add remaining geometries
  v WGS72
  v WGS84
  o Cube
  o Torus
  o Williams Pear
= getXYZtoLLH()  (opposite of getLoc3D())
  o Done for NS and AE, though AE must check if off edge
- Add Rotation Axis
- Great circle plane
- Tangent plane
- View Cone

Plane
-----
+ Add plane primitive from Point, Normal. What about orientation (rotation about normal) and extent/size?
  o Functional plane implemented, may need additional From* methods

SkyBox
------
- Mark stars from catalogue (on the cube surface to avoid parallax)
- Rotate to sidereal time
- Add Constellation markers

Track
-----
- To display flight path, satellite orbit, etc.
- Load path from file data
  o TLE (SGP4)
  o KML (Google Earth)
- Interpolate gaps by
  o Great circle distance
  o lat-lon lerp (rectangular line)
  o Straight line on AE
- Arrow to Sun direction
- Arrow to Moon direction
- Ground arrow to tracked object, possibly tied to Location rather than Track

Solar System
------------
- Planet Newtonian vectors
- Observation angles
- Textured objects, use SphereUV if possible

Main window
-----------
- Text lines for
  v Date and time UTC no DST
  o Sun RA/Dec
  o Moon RA/Dec

Camera
------
- Strafe
- LookAt that is not Origin
- Ability to view from Location (Separate camera?)
- Multiple cameras with PiP view

Graph
-----
- To plot Equation of Time against Analemma or Orbital speed in Solar System etc

Solar Eclipse path
------------------

Ground sky view
---------------
- displays the current sky with paths and planets
- Moon must librate and rotate correcly, along with phase
- Render to 360 view


Layer system
------------
- Add frames / separators
- Add render targets such as 360 cube map -> 360 video frame



Other ideas
-----------
+ Refactor Primitives
  + Share Primitive3D, Verts and Tris structs
  + Possiply inherit from base Primitive class
  + Still need to do Dots and Cylinders - done!
  + Normalize the primitive cache's in Earth/Location/etc
    + Still need to review Location again - done!

- Would a Star class be useful? Could tie to SkyBox and Location / Earth and help manage catalogue
- Implement a Location catalogue (airports, major cities, etc), and billboard callout for Location or Earth::Dot
- Consider how to handle view transformations and scale of Earth/SolarSystem for great precision and clipping
- Work out Rise, Culmination and Set times & indicators for Location
- Perhaps make views from Moon and Planets
- Animation and scripting - make a plan and test options
