Celestial Navigation
====================

Sight Reduction
---------------
When sighting celestial objects using a sextant there are a number of corrections which must be applied. These are, in order:

Hs is the sighted height.

Instrument Error
Caused by inaccuracies in the sextant itself. There are procedures to assess and minimize instrument error via adjustments, but it can rarely be eliminated.

Height of Eye / Dip Correction
The instrument height above sea level affects where the visible horizon will appear. Dip Correction adjusts for this, resulting in an observation as if made at sea level.
Dip Correction is performed using the appropriate table in the Nautical Almanac.

Ha is the apparent height, after applying the above two corrections.

Limb Correction - Altitude Correction 1
Stars and planets can be considered point-like, and require no limb correction.
The Sun and Moon are sighted using either their upper or lower limb, but astronomical tables always give the center position.
AC1 corrects from upper/lower limb to the center. The table for the Sun is entered with measured altitude (corrected for Instrument Error and Dip).
Since the Sun's apparent semidiameter varies with the distance to the Sun, there are actually two tables; OCT-MAR and APR-SEP.
The first is when Earth is closer to perihelion, the second when closer to aphelion.

Refraction - Altitude Correction 2
This corrects for refraction, depending on local temperature, pressure and the apparent altitude.

H0 is the height value after applying the above two corrections, and is suitable for lookups in astronomical tables.
