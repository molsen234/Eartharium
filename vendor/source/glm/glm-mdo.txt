1. download GLM:
https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html

2. Extract and place the header files in vendor\includes\glm folder

3. Use by adding #include <glm/glm.hpp> (and gtc/gtx/ext if required) to own project file.

That's it, GLM is a headers-only library and does not require separate compilation.
